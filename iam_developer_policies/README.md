## iam\_developer\_policies

These policies attempt to give users freedom while being
less brittle than a wildcard privilege. Access is restricted
to resources:

- With a specific prefix.
- In the specified region.
- For a specific account ID.

See example in [iam_\developer\_role](../iam_developer_role/README.md).
